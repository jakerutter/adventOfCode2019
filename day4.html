<h1>Day 4 Part 1</h1>
<div>
    --- Day 4: Secure Container ---</div><div>
        You arrive at the Venus fuel depot only to discover it's protected by a password. The Elves had written the password on a sticky note, but someone threw it out.
        </div><div>
            However, they do remember a few key facts about the password:
        </div><ul><div>
            It is a six-digit number.
        </div><div>
            The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.
        </div><div>
            Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345).
        </div><div>
            Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).
        </div></ul><div> </div><div>
            Other than the range rule, the following are true:
    </div><ul><div>
        111111 meets these criteria (double 11, never decreases).
    </div><div>
        223450 does not meet these criteria (decreasing pair of digits 50).
    </div><div>
        123789 does not meet these criteria (no double).
        </div></ul><div> </div><div></div>
            How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet these criteria?

<h1>Day 4 Part 2</h1>
<div>
    --- Part Two ---</div><div>
    An Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching digits are not part of a larger group of matching digits.
</div><div>
    Given this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:
</div><ul><div>
    112233 meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.
</div><div>
    123444 no longer meets the criteria (the repeated 44 is part of a larger group of 444).
</div><div>
    111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double 22).
    </div></ul></div><div>
    How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?
